Taking Flashing/Blinding in valorant one step further.

The Unity project is not polished. 

Looking to upload the whole unity project soon.

Currently the app looks for the server in 192.168.0.41:8080
You can change it when i upload the complete unity project. Or you could just set a static local ip.

Used Google Cardboard Libraries for the Unity project which is kinda "expired"/"not supported anymore"
Project to demonstrate the interaction between a Python Server and Unity Mobile Client.
